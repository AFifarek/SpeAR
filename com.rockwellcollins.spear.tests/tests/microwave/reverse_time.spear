Specification reverse_time

Inputs:
	time : int

Outputs:
	l : int
	m : int
	r : int
	
Macros:
	div_by_60 : int = time / 60
	left : int = if div_by_60 > 9 then 9 else div_by_60
	
	div_by_10 : int = (time - (div_by_60 * 60)) / 10
	middle : int = if div_by_10 > 9 then 9 else div_by_10
	
	remainder : int = (time - (div_by_60 * 60)) mod 10
	right : int = remainder

Assumptions:
	a0 = 0 <= time and time <= 639

DerivedRequirements:
	dr0 = l == left
	dr1 = m == middle
	dr2 = r == right

Requirements:
	p0 = 0 <= l and l <= 9
	p1 = 0 <= m and m <= 9
	p2 = 0 <= r and r <= 9
