Specification test2

Units:
	m "meters"
	s "seconds"

	m3 : m*m*m "cubic meters"
	m3_per_second : m3/s "cubic meters per second"
	
Types:
	//extend English prepositional phrases to this section
	switch_state is an enum {ON, OFF, FAILED}
	flow_type is a real m3_per_second
	
	button : enum {PRESSED, NOT_PRESSED}
	valve_state : enum {OPEN, CLOSED}
	
Constants:
	C1 is an int = 5
	C2 : int = 5

Inputs:
	simple_bool : bool

	switch is a switch_state
	emergency_stop is a button
	reset is a button
	
	a is a bool
	b is a bool

Outputs:
	valve_state is a valve_state
	valve_flow is a flow_type
	
State:

Macros:
	no_valve_flow is a bool = valve_flow == 0.0 m3_per_second
	positive_valve_flow is a bool = valve_flow greater than or equal to 0.0 m3_per_second
	
	reset_is_pressed is a bool = reset == PRESSED
	reset_is_not_pressed is a bool = reset <> PRESSED
	
Assumptions:
	a01 = not a

DerivedRequirements:
	r01_english = "While the switch is on it will always be the case that the valve flow is greater than or equal to 0.0 cubic meters per second"
	r01_old = switch == ON implies valve_flow >= 0.0 m3_per_second
	r01_current = switch equal to ON implies positive_valve_flow
	r01_desired = if switch equal to ON then valve_flow greater than or equal to 0.0 m3_per_second
	
	r02_english = "After emergency stop button is pressed the emergency valve will be open"
	r02_old = once emergency_stop == PRESSED implies valve_state == OPEN
	text = "After emergency stop button is pressed the emergency valve will be open"	
	
	r02_current = after emergency_stop equal to PRESSED implies valve_state equal to OPEN
	
	//r02_desired = ?? 

	//add an initial keyword
	r03 = initially (valve_flow equal to 0.0 m3_per_second)
	r03_error = initially (valve_flow == 0.0 m3_per_second) and initially (valve_state == OPEN)

	//consider a transition operator
	// state == A and guard transitions state == B
	// pre_state == A and guard implies state == B
	
	//investigate the use of since and triggers to implement between and after until
	r04 = after emergency_stop equal to PRESSED until reset equal to PRESSED implies no_valve_flow
	r04_base = emergency_stop == PRESSED triggers not (reset equal to PRESSED) implies no_valve_flow
	r04_alt = emergency_stop equal to PRESSED triggers reset not equal to PRESSED implies no_valve_flow
